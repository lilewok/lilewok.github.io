This research investigates the effectiveness of gamified learning in bolstering cybersecurity awareness within higher education. Given the rising challenges posed by cybersecurity threats in academic settings, the study aims to address the engagement gap in traditional training methods. By leveraging gamification, the integration of game elements into educational contexts, this research explores the potential to enhance motivation and knowledge retention among faculty, staff, and students.
The paper commences with an overview of cybersecurity challenges confronting higher education institutions and the need for innovative approaches to training. Introducing the concept of gamification, the study delves into its capacity to augment cybersecurity education outcomes. A comprehensive review of existing literature on gamification in cybersecurity education highlights its merits and limitations.
The empirical phase of the study involves a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative and qualitative data collection methods, including pre- and post-assessments and surveys, are used to assess the impact of gamified learning on participants' cybersecurity knowledge, attitudes, and engagement. Findings are analyzed to discern improvements in cybersecurity awareness as well as participants' satisfaction with the gamified training approach.
In conclusion, the research underscores the implications of its findings for the integration of gamified learning platforms into cybersecurity education. Recommendations for future research and the development of effective gamified cybersecurity training programs are offered. By unlocking the potential of gamified learning, this study contributes to the ongoing pursuit of heightened cybersecurity preparedness within higher education institutions.

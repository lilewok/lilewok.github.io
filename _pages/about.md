Introduction
======

Hello and welcome to my page.  My name is Crystal Jones-Howe and I am a 2nd year part-time PhD student at the University at Albany, State University of New York. <br/>
My passion for technology started at a young age as i was known for taking things apart and wanting to create.  However, the true possibility of technologies impact occured during my early teens when i first came in contact with this budding technology called the internet.  <br/>
I credit the internet with changing the trajectory of my life and i have been fortunate enought to see it's growth and the impact it has on the world.  It expanded my world view, and opened my future to possibilities that were previous unimaginable <br/>

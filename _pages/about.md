Introduction
======

Hello and welcome to my page.  My name is Crystal Jones-Howe and I am a 2nd year part-time PhD student at the University at Albany, State University of New York. My primary specializtion is a self-designed study in Technology in Education, with a secondary specializtion on Information in Organizational Environments.<br/>
My passion for technology started at a young age as I was known for taking things apart and wanting to create.  However, the true possibility of technology's impact occurred during my early teens when I first came in contact with this budding technology called the Internet.  <br/>
I credit the internet with changing the trajectory of my life and i have been fortunate enough to see its growth and the impact it has on the world.  It expanded my world view and opened my future to possibilities that were previously unimaginable. <br/>
Currently, I reside in the beautiful Hudson Valley with my husband, my daughter, our two adorable dogs and one grumpy but spoiled cat.  I am a Sr. IT Support Administrator at Dutchess Community College, where i manage the student-staffed helpdesk and mentor the students as they start their journey into their technology careers.  <br/>

More About Me
-----

I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY to an immigrant mother and african-american navy vet father; the youngest of their three children.  Unfortunetly, i lost my father at a young age, and watched as my mother worked hard to still provide a life and instill an importance of education on the three of us. <br/>
Adding much to her stress, she soon found that my unihibited imagination and dextrous fingers could not be stopped when wanting to figure out how something worked.  I was drawn to what, at the time, would be considered the more "boy-ish" hobbies of science and techy toys, super heroes, and action cartoons. While i had my fair share of barbies, it was clear my interest were broader then what was presented to me.<br/>
At the age of 13, my older sister, the first one in my family to attend college, gained access to a laptop provided by the college.  Little did everyone know how that would change my life.  In a time of chat rooms and talkers, i meet, spoke, and collaborated with people, not just across the US, but across the globe.   Things i have only seen in tv and movie, took on a new reality of something obtainable and created a desire to see and understand these things for myself.  <br/>
I was exposed to like minded individuals who had vastly different experiences than i had grown up with, which contributed to the scope of my imagination.  I learned more about computer science and what others could do and quickly started to absorb and research anything i could.  While i was still limited in my access, that didn't stop my curiosity so i took any opportunity to i could find. <br/>
As i continued in my education, it was interesting to see the path that i thought i clearly imagined was broaded by the many available careers in technology.  Even though i did not understand things like "learning styles" I understood that i was a very "hands-on" learner which led me to focus on Hardware Support and Network Administration.  I like, and still love, getting my hands on tech and being able to rebuild and reconfigure.  <br/>
Fortunetly, with the help of some wonderful instructors, i got the chance to reflect on my journey and realize the series of events that led me to where i was.  However, looking around, I also saw how technology was being utilized and the disparity that was evident in the educational sector.  Younger "me's" had technology placed in their hands with no real understanding of what it can do and how it can help.  They were not being prepared for the world as it has evolved.  While i was fortunate to be around as the internet developed, most under represented communities are not given the tools to properly utilize technology as is created today.  Both the pros and cons of such a vastly important necessity to operate in today's society. <br/>
